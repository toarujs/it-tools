## BREAKING CHANGE for Container Image

Since the _base image_ is now `nginx-unpriviledged` the container will now listen to port **8080** and not 80. So you need to update your port mapping, i.e. from `8080:80` to `8080:8080`.

<p align="center">
Useful tools for developer and people working in IT. <a href="https://it-tools.tech">Try it!</a>
</p>

You can override listening port using environment variable `PORT` (docker option `-e PORT=8888`).

You can serve the app from a subfolder using environment variable `BASE_URL` (docker option
`-e BASE_URL=/it-tools/`), without rebuilding the image -- see
[Host in a subfolder](#host-in-a-subfolder-it-tools).

If the container needs to listen to IPv6, it needs to be enabled: https://serverfault.com/questions/1147296/how-to-enable-ipv6-on-ubuntu-20-04. Alternatively, you can mount your own `nginx.conf` own using docker option `-v "./nginx.conf:/etc/nginx/templates/default.conf.template"` (with `listen [::]:8080;` removed)

## Proxmox Install

Run the command below in the Proxmox VE Shell

```bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/community-scripts/ProxmoxVE/main/ct/alpine-it-tools.sh)"```

## Build requirements

**To build this project**, around **8GB** of RAM is enough. Measured on a 4-core
machine, `pnpm build` peaks at roughly 6.5GB of system memory and completes on
Node's default heap — most of the work happens inside rolldown, in Rust, rather
than on the JavaScript heap.

## PR Welcome

Especially for UI improvements and translation. And for anything else.

## HTTPS is recommended

Some tools like PGP encryption rely on WebCrypto API that is only available in HTTPS/SSL. Also, if you want to use PWA, HTTPS is required.

So even on internal installations, you should enable HTTPS using Let's Encrypt using DNS Challenge

Some docs about DNS Challenge:

    container_name: it-tools
    image: sharevb/it-tools:latest
    pull_policy: always
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - 8080:8080
```

## Use in Podman Quadlet file

```
[Unit]
Description=IT Tools container
After=network-online.target

[Container]
AutoUpdate=registry
Image=ghcr.io/sharevb/it-tools:latest
PublishPort=8080:8080
Label=io.containers.autoupdate=registry

[Install]

```

## Use with companion Self Hosted docker services

Some tools requires additional docker services: HTTPS/DNS tools/Ping, HTML to PDF, Docker Image Download, Multi Links Download, Short Url Expander and TCP/UDP Port tester.

See complete example here: [docker-with-services](https://github.com/sharevb/it-tools/tree/chore/all-my-stuffs/docker-with-services)

## Filter tools and add home custom content

You can add custom content in Home page by mounting a `home.custom.md` in `/usr/share/nginx/html`.

You can filter available tools by mounting `tools-filter.json` in `/usr/share/nginx/html`. It can contains the following filtering regex:

```json
{
  "excludeCategoryFilterRegex": "",
  "includeCategoryFilterRegex": "",
  "excludeToolsFilterRegex": "",
  "includeToolsFilterRegex": ""
}
```

Category matches on category (English) names ; Tools matches on tools path/url.

See [docker-tools-filter-and-home-content](https://github.com/sharevb/it-tools/tree/chore/all-my-stuffs/docker-tools-filter-and-home-content)

## Add custom external tools

You can add custom external tools (href or markdownContent) by mounting a `external-tools.json` in `/usr/share/nginx/html` with the following structure:

```json
[
  {
    "name": "GitHub",
    "path": "/github",
    "description": "Link to Github",
    "keywords": ["github"],
    "category": "Links",
    "href": "https://github.com"
  },
  {
    "name": "Some text",
    "path": "/some-text",
    "description": "Some description",
    "keywords": ["some"],
    "category": "Links",
    "markdownContent": "Some useful **text**\n\nin *markdown*"
  }
]
```

See [docker-tools-filter-and-home-content](https://github.com/sharevb/it-tools/tree/chore/all-my-stuffs/docker-tools-filter-and-home-content)

## Setting default tools parameters / default UI language at runtime

For a complete sample, see [docker-with-services](https://github.com/sharevb/it-tools/tree/chore/all-my-stuffs/docker-with-services).

You can set default tool parameters by mounting a `tools-settings.json` in `/usr/share/nginx/html`.

It is a two level json, with the first level being for `tool name` and the second level for `parameter name`:

```json
{
  "regex-tester": {
    "multi": true,
    "regex": "some regex",
    "global": false
  }
}
```

You can find `tool name` and `parameter name` in the tools source code `src/tools` subfolder :

- example pattern for `const global = useQueryParamOrStorage({ storageName: 'regex-tester:g', name: 'global', defaultValue: true });`:

```json
{
  "regex-tester": {
    "global": false
  }
}
```

- example pattern for `const value = useQueryParam({ tool: 'barcode-gen', name: 'text', defaultValue: '123456789' });`:

```json
{
  "barcode-gen": {
    "text": "4356"
  }
}
```

- example pattern for `const width = useITStorage('ascii-text-drawer:width', 80);`:

```json
{
  "ascii-text-drawer": {
    "width": 80
  }
}
```

To define the default UI language, add a `default_locale` key to json:

```json
{
  "default_locale": "fr"
}
```

## To build using a custom default language:

```
docker build -t it-tools-fr --build-arg VITE_LANGUAGE=fr .
docker run -d --name it-tools-fr --restart unless-stopped -p 8080:8080 it-tools-fr
```

## Host in a subfolder (`/it-tools/`)

The container serves the app from whatever path you point `BASE_URL` at. Nothing is baked
into the image, so the regular `latest` image works for any subfolder -- no rebuild, no
subfolder-specific tag:

```yaml
services:
  it-tools:
    image: ghcr.io/sharevb/it-tools:latest
    restart: unless-stopped
    environment:
      BASE_URL: /it-tools/
    ports:
      - 8080:8080
```

or `docker run -d --name it-tools -e BASE_URL=/it-tools/ -p 8080:8080 ghcr.io/sharevb/it-tools:latest`.

`BASE_URL` accepts `it-tools`, `/it-tools` and `/it-tools/` alike; the default is `/`.

You still want a reverse proxy in front -- [Nginx Proxy Manager](https://nginxproxymanager.com/),
[Traefik](https://traefik.io/traefik/), [caddy](https://caddyserver.com/) etc. -- passing
`/it-tools/` through to the container. It does not matter whether the proxy strips the
prefix before forwarding (`proxy_pass http://it-tools:8080/;`) or passes it on as-is
(`proxy_pass http://it-tools:8080;`): the container handles both.

One thing only the proxy can do, in the stripping setup: `/it-tools` without the trailing
slash never reaches the container, so redirect it there -- the sample's
`location /it-tools { return 301 /it-tools/; }`. When the prefix is forwarded instead, the
container does that redirect itself.

See the [sample docker-compose.yml and nginx.conf](https://github.com/sharevb/it-tools/tree/chore/all-my-stuffs/docker-subfolder-sample).
To run the sample:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sharevb/it-tools
cd it-tools/docker-subfolder-sample/
docker compose up
```

Then navigate to http://localhost/it-tools/

Two things worth knowing:

- Building with `--build-arg BASE_URL=/it-tools/` still works, but it now only changes the
  image's *default* -- the environment variable still wins at run time.
- On a read-only root filesystem the config template cannot be re-rendered at startup, so
  `BASE_URL` (like `PORT`) has no effect unless `/etc/nginx/conf.d` is writable -- mount a
  tmpfs or an emptyDir there. The container says so in its log.

## To build using a custom folder:

1. `BASE_URL="/it-tools/" pnpm build`
2. Rename the generated `dist` folder to `it-tools` and serve on `https://your-domain.com/it-tools`

## To build for GitHub Pages:

1. Enable GitHub Pages build and deployment option in your fork, under **Settings** > **Pages** and select **GitHub Actions** as the source
2. Add the following GitHub action to your repo: https://github.com/sharevb/it-tools/tree/chore/all-my-stuffs/.github/workflows/sharevb-github-pages-publish.yml

## To add authentication

Assuming you're already hosting it-tools behind a reverse proxy, you can configure forward-auth and enforce authentication from the reverse proxy

- [Official guides](https://docs.goauthentik.io/docs/add-secure-apps/providers/proxy/server_nginx) with nginx. Guides with other reverse proxy setups are available
- [Step-by-step setup guide with nginx-proxy-manager](https://geekscircuit.com/set-up-authentik-sso-with-nginx-proxy-manager/)

(thanks @jogerj)

## Deploy as LXC container

In Proxmox VE, you can use docker image directly:

```bash
sudo lxc-create -n sharevb-it-tools -t oci -- --url docker://ghcr.io/sharevb/it-tools:latest
```

### Recommended IDE Setup

To install VSCode in WSL2 (Windows), see: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/tutorials/wsl-vscode

[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the following extensions:

- [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) (and disable Vetur)
- [TypeScript Vue Plugin (Volar)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.vscode-typescript-vue-plugin).
- [Oxc](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=oxc.oxc-vscode) (oxlint + oxfmt)
- [i18n Ally](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=lokalise.i18n-ally)

with the following settings:

```json
{
  "editor.formatOnSave": true,
  "editor.defaultFormatter": "oxc.oxc-vscode",
  "editor.codeActionsOnSave": {
    "source.fixAll.oxc": "always"
  },
  "i18n-ally.localesPaths": ["locales", "src/tools/*/locales"],
  "i18n-ally.keystyle": "nested"
}
```

### Type Support for `.vue` Imports in TS

TypeScript cannot handle type information for `.vue` imports by default, so we replace the `tsc` CLI with `vue-tsc` for type checking. In editors, we need [TypeScript Vue Plugin (Volar)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.vscode-typescript-vue-plugin) to make the TypeScript language service aware of `.vue` types.

If the standalone TypeScript plugin doesn't feel fast enough to you, Volar has also implemented a [Take Over Mode](https://github.com/johnsoncodehk/volar/discussions/471#discussioncomment-1361669) that is more performant. You can enable it by the following steps:

1. Disable the built-in TypeScript Extension
   1. Run `Extensions: Show Built-in Extensions` from VSCode's command palette
   2. Find `TypeScript and JavaScript Language Features`, right click and select `Disable (Workspace)`
2. Reload the VSCode window by running `Developer: Reload Window` from the command palette.

### Project Setup

```sh
pnpm install --ignore-scripts
```

### Compile and Hot-Reload for Development

```sh
pnpm dev
```

### Type-Check, Compile and Minify for Production

```sh
pnpm build
```

### Run Unit Tests with [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/)

```sh
pnpm test:unit
```

### Run End-to-End Tests with [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/)

Playwright starts `pnpm preview` itself, so build first:

```sh
pnpm build
pnpm test:e2e
```

To iterate against the dev server instead, leave `pnpm dev` running and point
the tests at it. Playwright then leaves the server alone:

```sh
E2E_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5173 pnpm test:e2e
```

The dev server compiles routes on demand, so a first run against a cold one can
blow past the assertion timeouts. Open the pages once, or just run it again.

### Lint with [Oxlint](https://oxc.rs/docs/guide/usage/linter)

```sh
pnpm lint
```

### Format with [Oxfmt](https://oxc.rs/docs/guide/usage/formatter)

```sh
pnpm fmt
```

### Ensure CI (lock, oxlint, typecheck) will succeed

Before submitting a PR, run:

```sh
pnpm install --ignore-scripts && pnpm lint:fix && pnpm typecheck
```

### Create a new tool

To create a new tool, there is a script that generate the boilerplate of the new tool, simply run:

```sh
pnpm run script:create:tool my-tool-name
```

It will create a directory in `src/tools` with the correct files. You will need to fill `src/tools/_my-tool-name_/index.ts` with tool name, category, description... and then develop the tool.

## Installation methods

Local installation required installing first: `python3 make g++`
