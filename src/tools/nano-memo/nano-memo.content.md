**GNU nano** is a small, modeless terminal editor: you start typing straight away, and every command is a control or meta chord shown along the bottom of the screen.

> ℹ️ nano's own help writes `^X` for `Ctrl+X` and `M-X` for `Alt+X` (Meta). This sheet spells them out. On macOS, `Alt` is usually `Esc` pressed first, or `Option` with "Use Option as Meta" enabled.

## 🚀 Starting nano

```bash
# open a file (created on save if it does not exist)
nano <file>

# jump straight to a line, or a line and column
nano +42 <file>
nano +42,8 <file>

# show line numbers
nano -l <file>

# enable mouse support
nano -m <file>

# keep the indentation of the previous line
nano -i <file>

# convert typed tabs to spaces, 4 wide
nano -ET4 <file>

# do not wrap long lines
nano -w <file>

# keep a backup of the original as file~
nano -B <file>

# read-only view mode
nano -v <file>

# open at the position you left last time
nano -P <file>
```
