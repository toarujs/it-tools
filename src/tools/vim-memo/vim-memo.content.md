**Vim** is a modal editor: keys mean different things depending on the mode you are in. Most commands compose as **count + operator + motion** — `3dw` deletes three words, `d$` deletes to the end of the line — so learning a new motion instantly upgrades every operator you already know.

## ✏️ Entering Insert Mode

| Key       | Starts typing                                        |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `i` / `I` | Before the cursor / at the first non-blank character |
| `a` / `A` | After the cursor / at the end of the line            |

## 🔧 Operators & Text Objects

An operator waits for a motion or a text object. Doubling the operator (`dd`, `yy`, `>>`) applies it to the whole line.

| Operator           | Does                                  |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------- |
| `d`                | Delete (into a register)              |
| `c`                | Change — delete, then insert          |
| `y`                | Yank (copy)                           |
| `>` / `<`          | Indent / unindent                     |
| `=`                | Re-indent                             |
| `gu` / `gU` / `g~` | Lower-case / upper-case / toggle case |
| `gq`               | Reformat to `textwidth`               |

| Text object | Selects                                              |

| `iw` / `aw` | Inner word / a word plus its trailing space          |
| `is` / `as` | Sentence                                             |
| `ip` / `ap` | Paragraph                                            |
| `i"` `a"`   | Inside / including the double quotes                 |
| `i'` `a'`   | Inside / including the single quotes                 |

| `i<` `a<`   | Inside / including the angle brackets                |
| `it` / `at` | Inside / including an HTML or XML tag                |

ciw     change the word under the cursor
ci"     change everything inside the quotes
da(     delete the parentheses and their contents
yi{     yank the body of a block
2dd     delete two lines

## 📋 Copy, Paste & Registers

| Key            | Does                                                   |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `yy` (or `Y`)  | Yank the line                                          |
| `y<motion>`    | Yank what the motion covers                            |

| `:registers`   | Show every register                                    |
| `xp` / `ddp`   | Swap two characters / two lines                        |

> ⚠️ In Vim, deleting also _yanks_ — `dd` overwrites the unnamed register. Use `"0p` to paste what you last copied, or yank into a named register first.

## 🔍 Search & Replace

| Command                 | Does                                                       |

### The global command

`:g` runs an Ex command on every line matching a pattern — the power tool of Vim.

```text
:g/TODO/d           delete every line containing TODO
:v/keep/d           delete every line NOT containing 'keep' (:v is :g!)
:g/^$/d             delete all blank lines
:g/error/normal A;  append a semicolon to every matching line
:g/pattern/t$       copy matching lines to the end of the file
:g/pattern/m0       move matching lines to the top (reverses their order)
```

## 📄 A Starting `~/.vimrc`

```vim
set nocompatible
syntax on
filetype plugin indent on

set number relativenumber
set incsearch hlsearch ignorecase smartcase
set expandtab shiftwidth=2 tabstop=2
set scrolloff=5
set hidden
set undofile
set clipboard=unnamedplus

" a leader key, and a few mappings that pay for themselves
let mapleader = " "
nnoremap <leader>w :w<CR>
nnoremap <leader>/ :nohlsearch<CR>
nnoremap <C-h> <C-w>h
nnoremap <C-j> <C-w>j
nnoremap <C-k> <C-w>k
nnoremap <C-l> <C-w>l
```

> ℹ️ Mappings that start with `<leader>` are **your** configuration, not built-in Vim. If a leader shortcut on someone else's cheat sheet does nothing, that is why.
